                        <li><strong>Issues are found</strong> during testing, an audit or from user feedback.</li>
                        <li><strong>Issues are added</strong> to your product entry in this service.</li>
                        <li><strong>You update your accessibility statement</strong> in your product to point to the unique URL this service provides.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your statement updates in real-time</strong> as issues are added and resolved.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Your statement is always legally compliant and will automatically show if your service is 'fully' or 'partially' compliant based on the issues you've recorded.</p>
